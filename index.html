        There are potential synergies between sustainable development and, for
        instance, energy efficiency and renewable energy. Similarly, depending
        on the context<sup>48</sup> , biological CDR methods like reforestation,
        improved forest management, soil carbon sequestration, peatland
        restoration and coastal blue carbon management can enhance biodiversity
        and ecosystem functions, employment and local livelihoods. However,
        afforestation or production of biomass crops can have adverse
        socio-economic and environmental impacts, including on biodiversity,
        food and water security, local livelihoods and the rights of Indigenous
        Peoples, especially if implemented at large scales and where land tenure
        is insecure. Modelled pathways that assume using resources more
        efficiently or that shift global development towards sustainability
        include fewer challenges, such as less dependence on CDR and pressure on
        land and biodiversity. (<em>high confidence</em>) {3.4.1}

        >CCS is an option to reduce emissions from large-scale fossil-based
        energy and industry sources provided geological storage is available.
        When CO<sub>2</sub>is captured directly from the atmosphere (DACCS), or
        from biomass (BECCS), CCS provides the storage component of these CDR
        methods. CO<sub>2</sub>capture and subsurface injection is a mature
        technology for gas processing and enhanced oil recovery. In contrast to
        the oil and gas sector, CCS is less mature in the power sector, as well
        as in cement and chemicals production, where it is a critical mitigation
        option. The technical geological storage capacity is estimated to be on
        the order of 1000 GtCO<sub>2</sub>, which is more than the
        CO<sub>2</sub>storage requirements through 2100 to limit global warming
        to 1.5°C, although the regional availability of geological storage could
        be a limiting factor. If the geological storage site is appropriately
        selected and managed, it is estimated that the CO<sub>2</sub>can be
        permanently isolated from the atmosphere. Implementation of CCS
        currently faces technological, economic, institutional, ecological
        environmental and socio-cultural barriers. Currently, global rates of
        CCS deployment are far below those in modelled pathways limiting global
        warming to 1.5°C to 2°C. Enabling conditions such as policy instruments,
        greater public support and technological innovation could reduce these

        emissions calculated relative to a reference technology. Relative
        potentials and costs will vary by place, context and time and in the
        longer term compared to 2030. The potential (horizontal axis) is the net
        GHG emission reduction (sum of reduced emissions and/or enhanced sinks)
        broken down into cost categories (coloured bar segments) relative to an
        emission baseline consisting of current policy (around 2019) reference
        scenarios from the AR6 scenarios database. The potentials are assessed

        mitigation options are included mostly in settlement and infrastructure
        (e.g., efficient healthcare buildings) and cannot be identified
        separately. Fuel switching in industry refers to switching to
        electricity, hydrogen, bioenergy and natural gas. Gradual colour

        outside the global financial sector and in the context of economic
        vulnerabilities and indebtedness facing developing countries. Reducing
        financing barriers for scaling up financial flows would require clear
        signalling and support by governments, including a stronger alignment of
        public finances in order to lower real and perceived regulatory, cost
        and market barriers and risks and improving the risk-return profile of
        investments. At the same time, depending on national contexts, financial
        actors, including investors, financial intermediaries, central banks and
        financial regulators can shift the systemic underpricing of
        climate-related risks, and reduce sectoral and regional

        and to achieve mitigation goals across all sectors and regions. These
        gaps create many opportunities and the challenge of closing gaps is
        largest in developing countries. Accelerated financial support for
        developing countries from developed countries and other sources is a
        critical enabler to enhance adaptation and mitigation actions and
        address inequities in access to finance, including its costs, terms and
        conditions, and economic vulnerability to climate change for developing
        countries. Scaled-up public grants for mitigation and adaptation funding
        for vulnerable regions, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, would be
        cost-effective and have high social returns in terms of access to basic
        energy. Options for scaling up mitigation in developing countries
        include: increased levels of public finance and publicly mobilised
        private finance flows from developed to developing countries in the
        context of the USD 100 billion-a-year goal; increased use of public
        guarantees to reduce risks and leverage private flows at lower cost;
        local capital markets development; and building greater trust in
        international cooperation processes. A coordinated effort to make the
        post-pandemic recovery sustainable over the longer-term can accelerate
        climate action, including in developing regions and countries facing
        high debt costs, debt distress and macroeconomic uncertainty. (<em
